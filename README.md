# Property Finder

A Steel-powered web automation agent that searches any website for properties/listings, with full Raindrop monitoring for observability.

## What It Does

Searches any property listing website and extracts:
- Property/Listing Name
- Location (City/Region)
- Price and Currency
- Rating (out of 5)
- URL to listing
- Match Score (based on your keywords)

Results are ranked by match score and saved to `results.json`.

## Why This Demo?

This showcases realistic web automation challenges:

### Real-World Complexity
- **Any Website**: Works with vacation-rental sites, real-estate sites, booking platforms, and similar listing sites
- **Dynamic Content**: Handles JavaScript rendering via Steel
- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Steel handles protection from major sites
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Works across different site structures

### Monitoring Points
Every action is logged to Raindrop:
- Browser initialization timing
- Page load performance
- Listing extraction success/failure
- Data validation
- File save operations

### Signals for Alerts
- `task_success` / `task_failure` - Overall outcome
- `results_found` - Found results
- `no_results` - Empty search
- `slow_scrape` - Performance issues (>8s)
- `scrape_failure` - Scraping problems
- `thin_content` - Low content warning

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install steel-browser raindrop-ai raindrop-query python-dotenv openai
```

### 2. Get API Keys

**Steel**: https://steel.dev
Free tier: 100 browser hours/month

**Raindrop**: https://app.raindrop.ai
Sign up and get your API keys

### 3. Configure Environment

Create `.env` file:

```bash
STEEL_API_KEY=ste_your_steel_key
RAINDROP_WRITE_KEY=your_raindrop_write_key
RAINDROP_QUERY_API_KEY=your_raindrop_query_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_your_openai_key
```

**Note**: Raindrop uses separate keys for writing (`RAINDROP_WRITE_KEY`) and querying (`RAINDROP_QUERY_API_KEY`). Get both from https://app.raindrop.ai

### 4. Run It!

```bash
python PropertyFinder.py --url "https://example-vacation-rental.com/search?location=Porec" --prompt "apartments in Porec for vacation rental"
```

## Usage

### Basic Scraping

```bash
python PropertyFinder.py --url <url> --prompt "<what you're looking for>"

# Required Arguments:
#   --url       URL to scrape (any property listing site)
#   --prompt    Natural language description of what to find

# Optional Arguments:
#   --location    Location parameter for URL templates
#   --keywords    Scoring keywords, comma-separated (default: extracted from prompt)
```

### Examples

```bash
# Vacation rental search
python PropertyFinder.py --url "https://example-vacation-rental.com/search?location=Porec" --prompt "apartments in Porec"

# Real estate search
python PropertyFinder.py --url "https://example-real-estate.com/listings/split" --prompt "flats between 80 and 100 square meters"

# With custom keywords for better scoring
python PropertyFinder.py --url "https://example-real-estate.com/houses/zagreb" --prompt "houses with outdoor space" --keywords "garden,backyard,terrace,patio"

# URL templates with placeholders
python PropertyFinder.py --url "https://example-vacation-rental.com/s/{location}/homes" --location "Colorado" --prompt "secluded mountain cabin"
```

### Semantic Search Mode

Search your past runs using natural language:

```bash
# Search past runs by meaning
python PropertyFinder.py --query "mountain cabin finds"

# Find similar discoveries
python PropertyFinder.py --similar "waterfront property with outdoor space"

# Find sessions with issues
python PropertyFinder.py --issues
```

| Real estate listing sites | 10-15 | Good extraction for property sales |
| Vacation rental platforms | 10-11 | Vacation rentals with prices and ratings |
| Hotel booking platforms | 2-3 | Heavy JS rendering, limited results |
| Protected listing sites | 0 | Anti-bot protection |

### Signal Alerts

```
results_found (count: 11)

```

### Queries You Can Run in Raindrop

- `event:page_scrape` - See all scrape operations
- `signal:slow_scrape` - Find performance issues
- `results_found > 0` - Successful searches
- `duration_seconds > 10` - Slow executions
- `session_id:search_20260219_135720` - View specific run

## Match Scoring

Each property gets a "match score" (0-10) based on:
- Keyword matches in name, location, and description
- Price (cheaper = higher score)

Keywords come from:
- `--keywords` argument if provided
- Otherwise, automatically extracted from your `--prompt`

## Monitoring Benefits

### Without Raindrop
- Agent fails silently
- Don't know which step broke
- No performance tracking
- Hard to debug

### With Raindrop
- See exact failure point
- Full execution timeline
- Performance metrics
- Search by natural language
- Alert on anomalies
- Compare runs

## Troubleshooting

### No results found
- Try different prompt wording
- Check if the URL is correct
- Use `--issues` to find problematic sessions
- Watch the Steel session URL to see what's happening

### Fewer results than expected
- Some sites have anti-bot protection
- Check Raindrop traces with `--query "extraction listings"`
- Look at `raw_count` vs `valid_count` in traces

### Slow page loads
- Check Raindrop for `slow_scrape` signals
- Some sites can be slow with images loading
- Steel handles this automatically with timeouts

### Browser won't start
- Verify your Steel API key is correct
- Check you have browser hours remaining
- Look for `session_started` event in Raindrop
